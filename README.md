# Azure Automation Runbooks
Azure Automation Runbooks to make life easier for Azure Administrators

This repository contains PowerShell scripts that can be executed using Azure Automation Account runbooks. For each of them, a system-managed identity will be required in order for the runbook to authenticate against Azure subscription. The system-managed identity should have appropriate roles assigned to execute the actions.
